Hi, my name is Pedro! I'm a noob in coding, and I look forward to sharing my ideas with GitHub.
I'm interested in learning how to build a mobile application currently. I want to create an auto-clicker for my mom.
She needs one so, I told her I can build her one for free. 
if anyone can help me out, by giving me some tips, here is my email. pedrojaquez575@gmail.com
